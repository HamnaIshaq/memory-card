# Memory Card Approach

use functional components

## Game Process

show different cards on the screen (DONE)
show current score and best score
current score is the number of times user has clicked unique cards in 1 game turn
best score is the max num of unique cards a user has clicked in all game turns (other than refresh)
the user clicks on cards
remember the cards the user clicked on
shuffle all the cards
if a card is clicked twice, the user loses the game
re-start the game
if user clicks each card once, until all cards are clicked
then user wins the game
they can then restart the game as well

## Structure

Components:

- Card (to show image cards)
